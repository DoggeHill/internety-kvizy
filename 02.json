    "explanation": "In transport mode, only the payload is protected. In tunnel mode, the entire original packet is encapsulated in a new IPv6 packet, often used for VPNs."

    "question": "What is the Flow Label field used for in IPv6 QoS?",
    "options": [
      "To compress packet headers",
      "To encrypt flows",
      "To count the number of flows",
      "To identify packets belonging to the same flow for consistent QoS treatment"
    ],
    "correct": [3],
    "explanation": "The 20-bit Flow Label allows routers to identify packets belonging to the same flow and handle them consistently without examining upper-layer headers."

    "question": "Which security feature helps prevent IPv6 address scanning attacks?",
    "options": [
      "Randomized interface identifiers",
      "All subnet addresses are always allocated",
      "SEND protocol",
      "The large address space makes brute-force scanning impractical"
    ],
    "correct": [0, 3],
    "multipleCorrect": true,
    "explanation": "The huge IPv6 address space (2^64 addresses per subnet) makes scanning impractical, and randomized IDs prevent predictable addressing patterns."

    "question": "What is a Mobile IPv6 Correspondent Node?",
    "options": [
      "A node communicating with a mobile node",
      "A backup home agent",
      "A DNS server for mobile devices",
      "A router managing mobile connections"
    ],
    "correct": [0],
    "explanation": "A correspondent node is any IPv6 node that is communicating with a mobile node, which may be mobile or stationary."

  {
    "question": "How does NDP prevent address conflicts?",
    "options": [
      "Through Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)",
      "Through encryption",
      "By limiting the number of hosts",
      "By using DHCP exclusively"
    ],
    "correct": [0],
    "explanation": "DAD uses Neighbor Solicitation messages to check if an address is already in use before a node configures it on its interface."

    "question": "What is the Router Preference option in NDP?",
    "options": [
      "Determines router uptime",

      "Configures router encryption strength",
      "Sets bandwidth limits for routers"
    ],
    "correct": [1],
    "explanation": "The Router Preference option allows routers to indicate their relative preference for use as a default router, helping hosts choose the best default gateway."

    "question": "Which extension header would be used for end-to-end encryption in IPv6?",
    "options": [
      "Hop-by-Hop Options",
      "Routing Header",
      "ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)",
      "Fragment Header"

    "options": [
      "A security feature that filters Router Advertisement messages",
      "A QoS mechanism",
      "A routing protocol",
      "A compression algorithm"

    "correct": [0],
    "explanation": "RA Guard is a switch security feature that blocks rogue Router Advertisement messages from unauthorized devices, preventing attacks."
